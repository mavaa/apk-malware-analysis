# A selection of scripts for the Androzoo app database file

See [this wiki
article](https://github.com/alexander474/apk-malware-analysis/wiki/androzoo) for
instructions on how to get the androzoo csv file, latest.csv.gz. Put it in this
folder to use the scripts.

This folder contains the following scripts:

## csv_to_sqlite.py
Convert the csv file to a sqlite database*

WARNING: The .sqlite file will end up at about 4GB (latest.csv.gz is 2.1GB).
Make sure you have enough room for it.

## 10_random_apps.py
Get a list of 10 random apps, with title and sha256sum. Gives you the option to
get malware, "clean" or completely random apps, as well as downloading them.
